# Burgess-EmployeeApp

This is the Android App that provides a Live Feed to employees and enables Bluetooth tracking.

It's all built off Gradle, but there's one library that needs to be brought in. Follow the instructions under:

> https://parse.com/apps/quickstart#parse_push/android/existing

to install their SDK. (Pretty much just copy the Parse-*.jar file to /app/libs/. and Gradle will find it.
